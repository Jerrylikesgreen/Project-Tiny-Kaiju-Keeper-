## Overview
**Tiny Kaiju Keeper** is a 10-day game-jam prototype created in Godot 4.3.  
It blends classic virtual-pet nurturing with light minigames and branching evolution paths.

### Jam Scope Pillars :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
| Pillar | Short Description |
|--------|------------------|
| **Nurture Loop** | Feed — Clean — Play (one minigame for now). |
| **Branching Evolution** | Three growth stages leading to *Mothlyn* or *Gigazilla*. |
| **Fixed-Palette Charm** | All art uses a six-colour palette for a cohesive retro look. |
